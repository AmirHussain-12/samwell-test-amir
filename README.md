## Notes
- I made a custom route for updating the commments of a user for a particular question.
- The custom route is located in server.js while all default routes provided by json-server will work as it is.
- I used React for its component based architecture, great perfomance and simplicity.
- I used material-ui library components within React because of its consistent design, and responsive layout.
- Did it over the weekend. If I had more time there will be many other test cases which I could have written to ensure as I beleive in Test driven developement.
- I have followed AirBnB linting style in my code.
- For unit testing I have used jest.
